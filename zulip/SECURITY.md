# Security policy

Security announcements are sent to zulip-announce@googlegroups.com,
so you should subscribe if you are running Zulip in production.

## Reporting a vulnerability

We love responsible reports of (potential) security issues in Zulip,
whether in the latest release or our development branch.

Our security contact is security@zulip.com. Reporters should expect a
response within 24 hours.

Please include details on the issue and how you'd like to be credited
in our release notes when we publish the fix.

Our [security model][security-model] document may be a helpful
resource.

## Supported versions

Zulip provides security support for the latest major release, in the
form of minor security/maintenance releases.

We work hard to make [upgrades][upgrades] reliable, so that there's no
reason to run older major releases.
