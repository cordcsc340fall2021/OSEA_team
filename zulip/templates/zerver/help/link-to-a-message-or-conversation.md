# Link to a message or conversation

Share permanent links to messages, threads, and streams.  With Zulip,
it's easy to to link to specific (parts of) conversations from issue
trackers, documentation, or other external tools.

## Link to a stream or topic

{start_tabs}

1. Click on a stream or topic in the left sidebar.

1. Copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

{end_tabs}

!!! warn ""

    This works for all views, including searches.
    All URLs in Zulip are designed to be shareable.

## Link to a specific message

{start_tabs}

{!message-actions-menu.md!}

1. Click **Copy link to message**.

{end_tabs}

This will copy to your clipboard a permanent link to the message,
displayed in its thread (i.e. topic view for messages in a stream).

Viewing a thread via a message link will never mark messages as read.

Zulip uses the same permanent link syntax when [quoting a
message](/help/quote-and-reply).
