# Stream privacy settings

Streams are similar to chatrooms, IRC channels, or email lists in that they
determine who receives a message. There are three types of streams in Zulip.

* **Public**: Members can join and view the complete message history.
  Public streams are visible to Guest users only if they are
  subscribed (exactly like private streams with shared history).

* **Private, shared history**: You must be added by a member of the
  stream. The complete message history is available as soon as you are
  added.

* **Private, protected history**: You must be added by a member of the
  stream. You only have access to the messages that are sent after you are added.

## Privacy model for private streams

At a high level:

* Organization owners and administrators can see and modify most
  aspects of a private stream, including the membership and estimated
  traffic. Owners and administrators generally cannot see private
  stream messages or do things that would give them access to private
  stream messages, like adding new subscribers or changing the stream
  privacy settings.

* [Organization members and moderators](/help/roles-and-permissions)
  cannot easily see which private streams exist, or interact with them
  in any way until they are added.  Given a stream name, they can
  figure out whether a stream with that name exists, but cannot see
  any other details about the stream.

* From the perspective of a guest, all streams are private streams,
  and they additionally can't add other members to the streams they
  are subscribed to.

There are two situations in which an organization owner or
administrator can access private stream messages:

* Via some types of [data export](/help/export-your-organization).

* Owners and administrators can change the ownership of a bot. If a
  bot is subscribed to a private stream, then an administrator can get
  access to that stream by taking control of the bot, though the
  access will be limited to what the bot can do. (E.g. incoming
  webhook bots cannot read messages.)
