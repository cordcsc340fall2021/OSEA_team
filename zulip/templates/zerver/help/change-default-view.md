# Change default view

The default view in Zulip (i.e. what view you reach after logging in
to the Zulip web app or hitting the `Esc` keyboard shortcut repeatedly)
can be configured.  By default, **Recent topics** is the default view;
the previous default, **All messages**, is also supported.

[Contact us](/help/contact-support) if you'd like to be able to
configure a different view as the default.

### Change default view

2. Under **Display settings**, click on the **Default view** dropdown.

3. Select a view.

4. Open a new Zulip tab or press `Esc` twice (first to exit the
   settings overlay, and again to return to the default view) to see
   your changes in action.
