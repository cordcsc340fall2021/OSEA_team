# Change your timezone

Zulip always uses your computer's timezone for displaying dates and
timestamps (note that you need to reload Zulip after changing your
computer's timezone for changes to take effect).

By default, Zulip also indirectly displays your timezone to others, via the
**Local time** field of your [user profile](/help/view-someones-profile).
You can change the timezone Zulip displays to others.

### Change your timezone
